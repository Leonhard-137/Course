# Study Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes, primarily written in LaTeX.

## Folders

- **AstroRadiation**: Notes on Radiative Processes in High-Energy Astrophysics.
- **GR**: Notes on General Relativity.
- **ML**: Notes on Machine Learning.
- **particle**: Notes on Particle Physics.

Each folder contains `.tex` source files and, in some cases, compiled PDFs.
